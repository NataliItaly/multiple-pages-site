      First originating in China, the beverage's name there is hong cha due to
      the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately.Today, the
      drink is widespread throughout East and Southeast Asia, both in
      consumption and harvesting, including in China, Japan, Korea and
      Singapore. Similar variants are also available in South Asian countries.
      Black tea retains its flavour for several years. For this reason, it has
      long been an article of trade, and compressed bricks of black tea even
      served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia well
      into the 19th century.
